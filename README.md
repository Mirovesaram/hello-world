# hello-world
Is just a test.

Right now, I'm starting to learn about Github. The hello-world guide is very helpful.
I'm learning the programming languages CSS, HTML, javascript and C. I hope to help you and you help me between commits and pull-requests.
I created this function out of laziness, it skips exercises that have already been tested:
---
`int sys()
{
  int i = 0. f = 0, t = 1;
  char ans;
  printf("\nEx%d", n = n + 1);
  printf("\n\nDo you want to jump?\n");
  printf("Y/y or N/n\n");
  scanf("%s", ans);
  switch(ans)
  {
    case 'n':
      i = f;
      break;
    case 'N':
      i = f;
      break;
    case 'y':
      i = t;
      break;
    case 'Y':
      i = t;
      break;
    default:
      printf("\nAn unidentified response. Please try again.");
      i = 2;
      break;
  }
  if(i == 2)
  {
    n = n - 1;
  }
  else
  {
    n = n;
  }
  return i;
}`

And **n** variable is global and is responsible by counting exercises.
